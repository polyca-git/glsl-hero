/*
When you want to use math to animate, shape or blend sine and cosine are mostly used.
These two trigonometric functions work together to construct circles.
In a nutshell, given an angle(radians) they will return the correct position of x(cosine) and y(sine)
of a point on the edge of a circle with a radius equal to 1.
But, the fact that they return normalized values(between -1 and 1).
Look at 00008-1.png in the images it is "y = sin(x);"
The image is the sine wave. Look how the values flow smoothly between +1 and -1.
